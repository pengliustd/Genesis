"""Linear bounding volume hierarchies (LBVH) over sets of axis-aligned boxes: build and box queries.

A set holds one tree per batch over the same number of leaves. The caller writes the box of each leaf into the state,
builds the set, and traverses the trees it gets back (see BVHTreeState in array_class). The build follows
Karras (2012, "Maximizing Parallelism in the Construction of BVHs, Octrees, and k-d Trees").

A leaf carries two indices: i_a names it by its box, in the order the caller wrote them, and i_leaf by its slot in the
sorted order the tree is laid out in, the one leaves_idx maps back to i_a.
